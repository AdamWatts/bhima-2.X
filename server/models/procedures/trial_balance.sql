TrialBalanceErrors()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure validates records that are used in the Trial Balance before they are posted
to the General Ledger.  The records are run through a series of SQL queries to validate their
correctness.  The follow assertions are made:
 1. The transaction dates are within the identified period
 2. Every line has some sort of description (best practice)
 3. All affected periods are unlocked.
 4. All affected accounts are unlocked.
 5. All transactions are balanced.
 6. All transactions have at least two lines (required for double-entry accounting)

Please be sure to stage all transactions for use via the StageTrialBalanceTransaction()
call.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Running this query will return NULL if no errors have occurred.  If errors exist in the transaction,
the following table will be emitted.
+--------------------------------------+----------+------------------------------------------------+
| record_uuid                          | trans_id | code                                           |

TrialBalanceSummary()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure produces the traditional Trial Balance table showing the account balances for any affected accounts
prior to the balance (`balance_before`), the debits to the accounts (`debit_equiv`), the credits to the accounts
(`credit_equiv`), and the proposed balances at the end of the operation (`balance_final`).  It should be used before
posting to the General Ledger to ensure that all transactions are correctly processed.

To use this method, a Trial Balance must first be _staged_.  The application expects that the record_uuids of all
transactions are already placed in the stage_trial_balance_transaction table via a call to
StageTrialBalanceTransaction().

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Running this a table with the following type:
+------------+--------+----------------------+----------------+-------------+--------------+----------------+
